turnin_code:  pp_p4


Write an MPI C program to solve the hotplate problem.  Because MPI
programs are executed via mpiexec, there will necessarily be a small
change to the method by which programs are run.

To run the program I will type commands like this one:

    mpiexec -n 16  p4 500 600 100 100 100 400 0.01

where the 16 represents the number of ranks to use.

Rank 0 may act as a manager process here.  It can coordinate the
activities of the other ranks if you find that useful.  For that reason,
you may assume that the number of ranks specified will never be less
than 2.  Rank 0 should also produce all printed output.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p4.  Note that I only type the simple command "make" below in
order to have the program built.

    rm -rf p4
    rm -f *.o
    make
