turnin_code:  pp_p2


Write a C program using pthreads to solve the hotplate problem.  The new
program should conform to the same interface as p1 but will have one extra
command-line argument, i.e. the number of threads to use.

To run the program I will type commands like this one:

    ./p2 500 600 100 100 100 400 0.01 8

where the new value 8 represents the number of threads to work on the problem.

All threads should participate in the work, and the original thread should be
the one that produces the printed output.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p2.  Note that I only type the simple command "make" below in
order to have the program built.

    rm -rf p2
    rm -f *.o
    make
