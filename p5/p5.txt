turnin_code:  pp_p5


Write a C program that uses MPI to implement the same evalfunc
functionality in which you used pthreads or openmp before.  Because MPI
programs are executed via mpiexec, there will necessarily be a small
change to the method in which programs are run.

To run the program I will type commands like these:

    mpiexec -n 16  ./p5
    mpiexec -n 32  ./p5 N   ## where N is the number of solutions to find

where the 16 and 32 represent the number of ranks to use.

Rank 0 may act as a manager process here.  It can coordinate the
activities of the other ranks if you find that useful.  For that reason,
you may assume that the number of ranks specified will never be less
than 2.  Rank 0 should also produce all printed output.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p5.  Note that I only type the simple command "make" below in
order to have the program built.

    rm -rf p5
    rm -f *.o
    make
