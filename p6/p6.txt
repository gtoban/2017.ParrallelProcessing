turnin_code:  pp_p6


Write a C program that uses  CUDA  on c00 to solve the hotplate problem.
The new program should conform to the same command-line interface as p1.

To run the program I will type commands like this one:

    ./p6 500 600 100 100 100 400 0.01



Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all of your project files,
including a makefile that will build the executable program which MUST
be named p6.  Note that I only type the simple command "make" below in
order to have the program built.

    rm -rf p6
    rm -f  *.o
    make
